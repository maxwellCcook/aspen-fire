## Set up
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

### Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(MatchIt)
library(WeightIt)
library(ipw)
```

## The data
There are two data files you can play around with for this exercise: *colo_dat_full.csv* and *colo_data_for_matching.csv*. *colo_dat_full.csv* has the entire time series of data for the full (unmatched) dataset of federal and private forests in Colorado. *colo_data_for_matching.csv* is a file that's ready for the matching process without additional pre-processing: it has a row for each sample point in Colorado and five-year averages for the climate variables. 

## Simulate data
Simulated data is handy because we know the true effect of the treatment variable. Here, we'll write a function to simulate a dataset where we know the true effect of fire on species richness.
```{r}
### Function to simulate data and write it as a dataframe
simulate_data <- function(){
  
  ### Create variables in a dataframe
  
  ### Make column for observation ID
  df <- data.frame(id = seq(1,1000),
                   
                   ### Add columns for explanatory variables
                   
                   ### Add column for treatment variable
                   fire = c(rep(0,500), rep(1,500)),
                   
                   ### And the rest of the covariates
                   slope = c(runif(500, min = 50, max = 90), 
                             runif(500, min = 65, max = 150)),
                   elevation = c(runif(500, min = 150, max = 185), 
                                 runif(500, min = 165, max = 200)),
                   stream = runif(1000, min = 0, max = 1),
                   
                   ### And the error term
                   error = rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 5))
  
  ### Add a slope*slope variable
  df <- df %>%
    mutate(slope2 = slope^2)
  
  ### Make column for outcome variable (species richness) 
  df <- df %>%
    mutate(species_richness = 1 + 5*fire + 0.07*slope + 0.05*elevation + 2*stream - 0.005*slope2 + error)
  return(df)
}

### Simulate a dataset
data_for_ipw <- simulate_data()

### Make fire a factor variable
data_for_ipw <- data_for_ipw %>%
  mutate_at(vars(fire), 
            funs(factor))

### Take a look at the balance of the covariates before matching
data_for_ipw %>%
  dplyr::select(id, fire, slope, elevation, stream) %>%
  gather(variable, value, slope:stream, factor_key = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = variable, y = value, color = fire)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Variable") + ylab("Value")
### fires: 0 = unburned, 1 = burned

### You can also look at it in table form
covariate_summ <- data_for_ipw %>%
  group_by(fire) %>%
  summarise(slope_mean = mean(slope),
            slope_sd = sd(slope),
            elevation_mean = mean(elevation),
            elevation_sd = sd(elevation),
            stream_mean = mean(stream),
            stream_sd = sd(stream))
```

### IPTW
#### ipw package
```{r}
### Generate weights
weights_ipwpoint <- ipwpoint(exposure = fire,
                             family = "binomial",  # The treatment is binary
                             link = "logit",
                             denominator = ~ slope + elevation + stream,
                             data = data_for_ipw)

### Add weights to dataset
data_ipw_point <- data_for_ipw %>%
  mutate(ipw = weights_ipwpoint$ipw.weights)

### Estimate ATE
model_ipwpoint <- lm(species_richness ~ fire +
                       slope + elevation + stream,
                     data = data_ipw_point,
                     weights = ipw)

### View summary
summary(model_ipwpoint)
```
## Actual dataset
```{r}
